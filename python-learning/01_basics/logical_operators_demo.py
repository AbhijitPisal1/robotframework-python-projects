# Logical operators demonstration with various comparisons

# Evaluates if "yellow" is greater than "cyan" and if "brown" is greater than "magneta"
print("yellow" > "cyan" and "brown" > "magneta")  
# 'yellow' > 'cyan' is True, 'brown' > 'magneta' is False; therefore, overall result is False

# Evaluates if 25 is greater than 50 or if 1 is not equal to 2
print(25 > 50 or 1 != 2)  
# '25 > 50' is False, '1 != 2' is True; therefore, overall result is True

# Evaluates if 42 is equal to "answer"
print(not 42 == "answer")  
# '42 == "answer"' is False, so 'not False' is True; therefore, overall result is True

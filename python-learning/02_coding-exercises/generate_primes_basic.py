# Question: Generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit (without using shortcuts)
# Given a number `limit`, generate all prime numbers from 2 up to that number.
# Avoid using any shortcuts like the Sieve of Eratosthenes, square root optimization, or built-in helpers.
# Example: limit = 10 â†’ [2, 3, 5, 7]

"""
Approach:
Define a function `is_prime(n)` that checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility
from 2 to n-1. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.

Define another function `get_primes_up_to(limit)` that:
- Iterates from 2 to the given limit.
- For each number, uses `is_prime()` to check if it's a prime.
- If it is, append it to the list of primes.
- Finally, return the list of primes.

This approach demonstrates the fundamental logic for finding prime numbers
without relying on optimizations or advanced techniques. It is ideal for learning and clarity.

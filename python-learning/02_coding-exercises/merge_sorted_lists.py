# Question: Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
# Without using sorted() on final result
# list1 = [1, 4, 2]
# list2 = [6, 3, 5]

"""
Explanation:
First, the input lists may not be sorted, so we need to sort each list individually without using sorted() on the final combined list.
We will implement a simple sorting function (like insertion sort) for each list to ensure they are sorted.
After sorting both lists, we merge them in a classic two-pointer approach, comparing elements one by one to produce a final sorted merged list.
This approach ensures we don't use Python's built-in sorted() on the combined list but rely on sorting individual lists first, then merging.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) due to insertion sort on each list + O(n) merge
Space Complexity: O(n) for the merged output list

"""
Note on handling numbers and strings:

- For numbers:
  Convert each number to a list of digits using:
      digits = [int(d) for d in str(number)]
  Then apply the sorting and merging functions on these digit lists.
  Finally, join the merged list back to form a number if needed.

- For strings:
  Each string can be treated as a list of characters directly.
  Apply sorting and merging functions as is.
  Join the merged list back into a string if needed.

The core sorting and merging logic remains unchanged.
Only input preparation (number â†’ digit list) and final conversion differ.

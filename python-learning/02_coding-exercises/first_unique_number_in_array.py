# Question: First unique number in a given array
# Given an array, find the first number that appears only once.
# Example: [2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5] â†’ 1

"""
Approach:
First, count the occurrences of each number by iterating through the array once using a dictionary.
Then iterate through the array a second time, checking the count of each element.
The first element with a count of 1 is the first unique number.
If no unique number is found, return None.
This approach requires two passes over the array but ensures the correct order is preserved.

        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1

    for num in arr:
        if count_dict[num] == 1:
            return num
    return None

# Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the array
# Space Complexity: O(n) for the dictionary storing counts

# Test case
test_arr = [2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5]
print("Output:", first_unique_number(test_arr))  # Output: 1

"""
Note:
To apply this logic for a number (e.g. 234567987654234567), convert the number to a string:
    for digit in str(number): ...
Then use the same logic to find the first unique digit.

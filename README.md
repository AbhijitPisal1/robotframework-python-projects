## Repository Overview

This repository is an excellent starting point for beginners who wish to learn test automation using **Robot Framework** and **Selenium** in Python. The repository also contains additional resources to help enhance your Python programming skills and prepare for job interviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+** (Required for running the repository)
- **Robot Framework** (Test automation framework)
- **Selenium** (WebDriver for browser automation)

## Installation Instructions

To get started with this repository on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Python 3.8+**: Make sure you have Python 3.8 or above installed on your system.
2. **Git Bash**: You will need **Git Bash** (or any other terminal of your choice) to clone the repository.
3. **IDE**: You can use **Eclipse** or **PyCharm** to open and work with the repository.

### Steps to Clone and Set Up:
```plaintext
1.	**Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/AbhijitPisal1/robotframework-python-projects.git
   cd robotframework-python-projects
2.	Set up a Python virtual environment (Optional but recommended):
3.	python3 -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
4.	source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
5.	venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
6.	Install the required dependencies:
7.	pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all necessary packages, including Selenium, Robot Framework, and other Python dependencies.

### Folder Structure
The repository is organized into several folders to help you learn and practice different aspects of Python, Test Automation, and Agile SDLC. Here’s a breakdown of the folder structure:
1. python-learning:
A collection of folders to strengthen your Python fundamentals and OOP understanding. It covers python basics and real-world OOP projects like an E-commerce platform, and Library System. Also includes a set of commonly asked Python interview questions with solutions.
2. interview-preparation-files :
Interview prep material focused on Test Automation, SDLC, and Agile. Contains concise notes on key topics such as API Testing, BDD, CI/CD, XPath, Git, POM, and more, including behavioral questions.
3. robotframework-mini-projects:
This folder contains mini projects designed to help you gain hands-on experience with **Selenium** and **Robot Framework**. These projects will allow you to practice various automation techniques, including **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)**, **Gherkin**, and **Keyword-Driven Testing**. Whether you're just starting with automation or looking to refine your skills, these projects will guide you through real-world scenarios.

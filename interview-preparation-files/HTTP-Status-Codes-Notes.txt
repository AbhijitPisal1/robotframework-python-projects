101 Switch : The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server has agreed.
103 Early hints : Return some response headers before final message

2xx - Successful Responses :-> The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
200 OK: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource.
201 Created: The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource was created as a result.
202 Accepted: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is not complete.
204 NO content : Server processed requested successfully but no content is returned.

3xx - Redirection Messages :-> Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete their request.

501  Not Implemented: The HTTP method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled.

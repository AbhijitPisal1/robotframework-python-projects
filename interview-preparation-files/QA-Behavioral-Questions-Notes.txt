=================================================================================
Q) You are asked to automate a functionality that is not yet fully developed. How do you handle this?
Ans.) I would first collaborate with the development team to understand the expected functionality and its requirements. Then, I would create a partial automation framework that allows for testing as features become available, using stubs or mocks for the uncompleted parts to ensure a flexible test strategy.
=================================================================================
Q) If a Test fails, what will be your next step?
Ans.) I would analyze the test logs, investigate the cause of the failure, and check if it’s related to the application or the script. After identifying the issue, I would log it in the bug tracking system and re-run the test after the fix is implemented.
=================================================================================
Q) If the application has minor changes, what would be your approach to modifying the Automation scripts?
Ans.) I would review the affected areas of the script, make necessary adjustments, such as updating locators or expected results, and ensure that the modified scripts pass all regression tests for those functionalities.
=================================================================================
Q) How would you automate login functionality for a website?
Ans.) I would utilize the Robot Framework with Python to write a test case that navigates to the login page, inputs valid credentials, and asserts successful login by verifying the presence of an element unique to the logged-in state. Additionally, I could employ libraries such as `Selenium` for browser automation, using functions like `driver.findelementbyid()` to locate input fields and `driver.submit()` to submit the login form.
=================================================================================
Q) How would you automate a test scenario where you need to check if an email is sent after user registration?
Ans.) I would automate the user registration process and then use an email testing tool such as `MailHog` or `pytest-email` to verify that the email was received. I would check for the correct subject, sender, and content by leveraging libraries like `smtplib` for sending a test email or `imaplib` for fetching it from the inbox.
=================================================================================
Q) How would you automate a scenario where you need to validate the contents of a downloaded file after clicking a button on a webpage?
Ans.) I would automate the button click action using Selenium, confirm the file download, and then use Python’s built-in `open()` function or libraries like `pandas` or `csv` to read and validate the file content against expected results, ensuring that all required data is present and correct.
=================================================================================
Q) How would you automate a scenario where you need to verify a specific color, font, and position of an element on a webpage?
Ans.) I would use Selenium with Python to locate the element and retrieve its CSS properties using `element.valueofcssproperty()`. I would then assert these properties to confirm they match the expected values for color, font, and position, ensuring the validation is thorough.
=================================================================================
Q) How would you automate a scenario where you need to verify if a user can scroll down a webpage until the footer section is visible?
Ans.) I would simulate scrolling actions using JavaScript with `driver.executescript("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")` to scroll the page. Then, I would check if the footer element is present in the viewport using assertions, such as `element.isdisplayed()`, to confirm its visibility on the page.
=================================================================================
Q) You've been asked to automate a legacy application. What is your approach?
Ans.) I would first assess the existing application architecture and identify the testing requirements. Then, I would design automation strategies that integrate with legacy systems, possibly using tools compatible with older technologies and ensuring thorough documentation is maintained.
=================================================================================
Q) A script you wrote was working fine yesterday but is failing today. How do you troubleshoot?
Ans.) I would check for any recent changes in the application code, validate the test environment, and review the logs for error messages to pinpoint the cause of the failure. After this, I would make adjustments as necessary.
=================================================================================
Q) Your Automation scripts are running slowly. How can you improve the speed?
Ans.) To improve speed, I would optimize the scripts by implementing efficient locators, reducing unnecessary waits, and possibly running tests in parallel. I would also review the test data management practices to streamline performance.
=================================================================================
Q) Your Automation script is failing due to a change in the application. How do you handle this?
Ans.) I would quickly identify the changed elements and update the script accordingly. Additionally, I would coordinate with the development team to understand the changes and ensure our automation remains aligned with the current state of the application.
=================================================================================
Q) How would you pick test cases for regression testing?
Ans.) I would select test cases based on risk analysis, critical functionality, and previous defect history to ensure that the most impactful areas of the application are covered while maximizing test coverage.
=================================================================================
Q) Suppose a developer is not fixing a bug; how would you approach the situation?
Ans.) I would communicate directly with the developer to understand any challenges they might face and advocate for a priority resolution, clearly articulating the impact of the bug on the overall project.
=================================================================================
Q) In your framework, if you have 100 pages, do you create 100 Page Objects?
Ans.) While creating 100 Page Objects for 100 pages adheres to the Page Object Model's principles of modularity and reusability, it's essential to evaluate the necessity of each object. If multiple pages share similar functionalities, it may be more efficient to consolidate them into fewer Page Objects. This approach reduces complexity and maintenance overhead while maintaining clean, manageable code. Ultimately, the goal is to balance modularity with efficiency, ensuring the framework remains practical and easy to update
=================================================================================
Q) How to handle high priority release in a short time?
Ans.) I would focus on test case selection based on critical features, execute high-priority tests first, and collaborate closely with the development team to ensure swift resolution of any identified issues.
=================================================================================
Q) How to handle projects without documentation?
Ans.) I would initiate discussions with team members to gather informal knowledge, create my own documentation as I learn, and establish a systematic way to capture insights throughout the project lifecycle to foster clarity for future efforts.
=================================================================================
Q) You find an intermittent bug that appears only in production, not QA. How would you approach investigating it?
Ans.) I would start by analyzing production logs and monitoring data to identify any patterns or triggers around the bug. I'd try to reproduce the issue using production-like data and environment settings. If necessary, I’d implement additional logging or telemetry in the production system to capture more details. Collaborating with developers and stakeholders to isolate the root cause would be key.
=================================================================================
Q) Your regression suite is taking too long to run. What steps would you take to optimize it?
Ans.) First, I’d analyze test execution time and identify bottlenecks. I’d then categorize tests (e.g., smoke, sanity, full regression) and implement test parallelization where feasible. I’d also consider removing redundant tests and moving non-critical tests to run in scheduled jobs rather than blocking deployments. Using test impact analysis to run only affected tests could further optimize execution time.
=================================================================================
Q) A build is failing due to failing automation tests. How would you debug and triage the issue?
Ans.) I’d first check the test report, logs, and screenshots (if available) to identify what failed. I’d verify if the failure is due to an actual defect, test script issue, or environment-related flakiness. I’d rerun the failing tests in isolation to confirm the behavior and collaborate with developers if needed. Prioritizing and labeling the issue properly (e.g., blocker, flaky, false positive) would guide the next steps.
=================================================================================
Q) How do you manage cross-browser testing in your automation? Which tools or strategies do you use?
Ans.) I use tools like Selenium Grid, BrowserStack, or Sauce Labs to execute tests across different browsers and devices. I ensure tests are browser-agnostic by avoiding hard-coded waits or browser-specific selectors. Tests are regularly run on a matrix of supported browsers to catch compatibility issues early.
=================================================================================
Q) Your automation tests are failing frequently due to minor UI changes. How can you improve the stability of your scripts?
Ans.) I’d make the scripts more resilient by using dynamic locators (like XPath with contains or regex), and avoiding brittle selectors like index-based XPaths. Introducing a page object model (POM) would centralize UI element definitions, making updates easier. Implementing visual testing tools like Percy or Applitools could help catch unintended changes while tolerating minor UI shifts.
=================================================================================
Q) Have you written custom utilities or libraries in your automation codebase? What problem did it solve?
Ans.) Yes, I’ve written custom utility libraries for reusable functions like waiting mechanisms, API calls, dynamic test data generation, and custom logging. These utilities helped reduce code duplication, improved maintainability, and enabled faster onboarding of new team members.
=================================================================================
Q) How do you balance between automating a test case vs. keeping it manual?
Ans.) I consider factors like test case stability, repeatability, criticality, and ROI. High-impact, frequently executed tests are prioritized for automation, while one-time or highly subjective exploratory tests are kept manual. If automation required extensive maintenance for a rarely-used feature, I’d opt for manual testing.
=================================================================================
Q) How do you handle test environment instability or downtime while running automated tests?
Ans.) I include environment health checks before test execution and implement retry logic for transient failures. Test cases are designed to fail gracefully and provide detailed failure logs. If instability is common, I raise the issue with DevOps and push for better monitoring and alerting.
=================================================================================
Q) What actions to perform if you ever faced a regression issue in production?
Ans.) If a regression issue occurs in production:
    - First, reproduce and analyze the issue.
    - Raise a defect with high severity.
    - Perform root cause analysis.
    - Add missing test coverage.
    - Create or update regression test cases.
    - Coordinate with dev team for quick fix and redeploy.
=================================================================================    
Q) What happens after a build comes to test? What will you test first?
Ans.) Once a build is available:
    - Perform Smoke Testing to ensure the build is stable.
    - If smoke passes, proceed with Functional, Regression, and Integration Testing.
    - Validate critical and high-priority features first.
    - Check logs, configurations, and environment setup before detailed testing.

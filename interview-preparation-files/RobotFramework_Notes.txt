================================================================================
Q.) What programming languages can you use to write test cases in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
For writing test cases, Robot Framework supports both Python and Java. However, test cases can also be created using other languages like Perl, Ruby, and.NET by utilizing the Remote Library Interface or the builtin telnet console of the Robot Framework.
================================================================================
Q.) What are the different types of test libraries in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
There are three types of test libraries in Robot Framework:
  Builtin libraries: These are preconfigured libraries that are a part of the Robot Framework and offer keywords for typical activities like file manipulation, text manipulation, and HTTP requests.
  Standard libraries: These thirdparty libraries are integrated with the Robot Framework and provide significant keywords for activities like database testing, GUI testing, and network testing.
  Custom libraries: These are created by the user and offer keywords for specific tasks or APIs.
================================================================================
Q.) What are the different test execution modes supported by Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
Robot Framework supports three methods to execute tests:
  Execution at the test case level: In this mode, each test case is run independently. 
  Execution at the test suite level: In this case, several test cases are run concurrently.
  Execution at the test run level: This method runs several test suites and produces a combined report.
================================================================================
Q.) Explain the overall architecture of Robot Framework.
Ans.) 
The Robot Framework is made up of four essential components:
  Test cases: These describe the expected behavior of the system being tested and are written in a tabular format using keywords.
  Test libraries: These offer the functionalities required to carry out operations on the system being tested. They can be created in any language that supports the   Remote Library Interface, including Python, Java, and others.
  Interpreter for the Robot Framework: This component interprets the test cases, runs the keywords, and interacts with the test libraries.
  Test execution environment: This is the environment in which the test cases are run. It could be a local computer or a remote server.
================================================================================
Q.) What is the role of the Robot Framework Interpreter?
Ans.) 
The Robot Framework Interpreter is responsible for parsing the test cases, executing the keywords, and communicating with the test libraries. It is implemented in Python and provides a set of standard libraries for performing common tasks.
================================================================================
Q.) How does Robot Framework integrate with external test libraries?
Ans.) 
The Robot Framework Interpreter is responsible for parsing the test cases, executing the keywords, and communicating with the test libraries. It offers a set of standard libraries for carrying out everyday operations and is implemented in Python.
================================================================================
Q.) What is the role of the Robot Framework Listener?
Ans.) 
The Robot Framework Listener is a plugin that can be used to keep track of how tests are running and obtain data for producing customized reports. It can be used to collect data on metrics such as test case start and end times and status. Python, Java, or any other language that implements the Remote Library Interface can be used to implement the listener.
================================================================================
Q.) What are the different configuration files used by Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
Following are the configuration files that Robot Framework uses:
  Settings file: The log level and output directory are two settings for the test execution environment that are specified in this file.
  Variable file: The variables used in the test cases and test suites are defined in this file. 
  Resource file: The resources utilized by the test cases and test suites, such as external libraries and additional test cases, are defined in the resource file
================================================================================
Q.) What is the syntax for creating a test case in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
Robot Framework uses a tabular syntax to build test cases.

  Example :
	| Test Case | My Test Case |
	| | Open Browser | http://www.google.com | chrome |
	| | Input Text | name=q | Robot Framework |
	| | Click Button | name=btnK |
	| | Wait Until Page Contains | Robot Framework |
================================================================================
Q.) How do you create a datadriven test case in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
Use test data in a tabular format, such as CSV, TSV, or HTML, to generate a datadriven test case in Robot Framework. The input values for each iteration of the test case should be included in the test data. The builtin keyword "Run Keyword For Each" can then be used to run a certain term for each row in the test data. Variables can also be used to dynamically access the information in the test data database. This method makes it simple to execute the same test case against several test data sets, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of your tests.
================================================================================
Q.) What are the different types of variables in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
Robot Framework supports three different types of variables:
  Scalar variables: Scalar variables are those that only store a single value, such a text or an integer. 
  List variables: Variables with a list of values, such as a list of characters or a list of numbers, are referred to as list variables.
  Dictionary variables: Similar to a Python dictionary, these variables store a keyvalue mapping.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you use conditional statements in Robot Framework test cases?
Ans.) 
In Robot Framework test cases, the builtin keywords "Run Keyword If" and "Run Keyword Unless" can be used to insert conditional statements. If a given condition is true, the "Run Keyword If" keyword runs the specified keyword; if the condition is false, the "Run Keyword Unless" keyword does the same. The "BuiltIn.Should Be True" and "BuiltIn.Should Be False" keywords can also be used to check conditions and take particular actions based on the outcomes. In the Robot Framework, you can create adaptable and dynamic test cases using these conditional statements.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you create custom keywords in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
When using Robot Framework, you can define a function in a Java or Python library and import the library into the test case. This allows the function to be used in the test case as a keyword.
Example :
  Python Library:
	def my_keyword(arg1, arg2):
	 	do something
  Robot Framework Test Case:
	| Test Case | My Test Case |
	|    | My Keyword | arg1 | arg2 |
================================================================================
Q.) How do you execute a test case in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
The Robot Framework's commandline tool or a test runner tool like PyCharm or Eclipse can be used to run a test case. 
  Example : robot my_test_case.robot
================================================================================
Q.) How do you generate a test report in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
Use the report argument with the robot commandline tool to create a test report in Robot Framework.
  Example : robot report my_report.html my_test_case.robot
================================================================================
Q.) How do you set up test suites in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
You can make new files with the .robot extension and define the test cases and variables in those files to set up test suites in the Robot Framework. The robot commandline tool may then be used to run the test suite using the suite argument.
  Example :robot suite my_suite my_test_cases.robot
================================================================================
Q.) How do you run a subset of test cases in Robot Framework?
Ans.) 
You can use the test parameter with the robot commandline tool to run a subset of the test cases in Robot Framework.
  Example : robot test test_case_1,test_case_2 my_test_cases.robot
================================================================================
Q.) How do you handle errors and exceptions in Robot Framework test cases?
Ans.) 
Robot Framework includes builtin keywords like "Run Keyword And Ignore Error" and "Run Keyword And Expect Error" that can be used to handle errors and exceptions. When a keyword is run with the "Run Keyword And Ignore Error" option, the test execution continues even if the keyword fails, but when the "Run Keyword And Expect Error" option is used, a specific error is expected and the test case fails if it doesn't occur. The "Run Keyword If Test Failed" and "Run Keyword If Test Passed" keywords allow users to run particular keywords based on the test status by creating custom exception handlers. By enabling robust error handling in test cases, these techniques help testers locate and successfully resolve issues.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you integrate Robot Framework with Selenium WebDriver?

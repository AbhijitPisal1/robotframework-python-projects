--- Page Object Model (POM) ---

================================================================================
Q.) Explain Page Object Model
Ans.
    The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern in Selenium.
     It helps create an object repository for storing web elements. Each page of the web application has a corresponding Page Class.
     Enhances test maintenance by organizing code.
     Reduces code duplication by separating classes for each web page. If a web element or functionality on a page changes, you only need to update the relevant page class, not every test case that uses it.
================================================================================
Q.) Explain the flow in POM when using BaseClass, TestClass, PageClass
Ans.
     Setup: TestClass starts by calling invokedriver() from BaseClass to initialize the WebDriver, open the specified URL, and maximize the browser window.
     BaseClass: Initializes WebDriver, manages browser setup and teardown, and sets up logging.
     LoginPage: Implements Page Object Model for the login page, interacts with web elements, and logs actions.
     Login Test: Contains TestNG test methods for login functionality, uses assertions, and logs test actions.
     Testng.xml: Configures TestNG suite for executing tests and includes a listener for reporting.
================================================================================
Q.) What are the advantages of using POM?
Ans.
     Reusability
     Better code maintainability
     Separation of test logic from page structure
     Less duplication of code
     If a web element or functionality on a page changes, you only need to update the relevant page class, not every test case that uses it.
================================================================================
Q.) How is POM different from Page Factory?
Ans. 
     POM is a design pattern, while Page Factory is a class in Selenium that provides an easier way to initialize web elements.
     Page Factory uses the @FindBy annotation to locate elements.
================================================================================
Q.) What is the role of constructors in POM?
Ans.
     Constructors in POM are used to initialize the WebDriver instance and other necessary configurations for the page class, such as initializing elements using Page Factory.
     Web elements in POM can be initialized using PageFactory.initElements(driver, this) or by creating a constructor and passing the driver instance.
================================================================================
Q.) What are the challenges faced while implementing POM?
Ans.
    Initial setup effort
     Need for clear organization of classes for complex applications
     Managing dependencies between page classes
================================================================================
Q.) What are the disadvantages of POM?
Ans.
     POM can lead to the creation of too many classes for large applications.
     Increased complexity in managing them.
================================================================================
Q.) Can you use multiple drivers in POM?
Ans.
     Yes, but it's essential to ensure that each page class or test class has its own driver instance to avoid conflicts.
================================================================================
Q.) What is the Page Object Model (POM) in Selenium, and why is it used?
Ans. 
     The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that creates a separate class for each page of a web application. Each page class contains elements and methods corresponding to actions on that page.
     POM helps:
         Increase Reusability: Page objects can be reused in multiple test cases.
        Enhance Maintainability: Changes to the UI only require updates to the page object class, not all tests.
        Improve Code Organization: Makes the test code cleaner and easier to understand.
================================================================================
Q.) What is the difference between Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory in Selenium?
Ans.
    POM: A design pattern where each page of the application is represented by a class.
     Page Factory: A class in Selenium that simplifies the initialization of elements in POM using the @FindBy annotation.
     Page Factory enhances POM by reducing repetitive calls to driver.findElement().
================================================================================
Q.) How do you initialize WebElements using Page Factory in Selenium?\
Ans.
     WebElements are initialized using the @FindBy annotation and the PageFactory.initElements(driver, this) method. This ensures elements are located and initialized when the page object is created.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you handle dynamic web elements in the Page Object Model (POM)?
Ans.
     For dynamic web elements, use explicit waits with WebDriverWait to ensure elements are visible or interactable before performing actions.
     Additionally, you can use relative XPath or other flexible locators to accommodate changing element properties.
================================================================================ 

--- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) ---

================================================================================
Q.) What is BDD, and how does it differ from TDD (Test-Driven Development)?
Ans.
     TDD (Test-Driven Development): In TDD, we write tests before coding. This approach ensures that code is tested during development, leading to simpler design and early bug detection.
The cycle is: write a failing test, implement the code, and refactor.
     BDD (Behavior-Driven Development): BDD focuses on collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders.
Scenarios are written in natural language (like Gherkin) to describe expected behavior.
It ensures that software meets user needs and improves communication.
     ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development): ATDD involves creating acceptance tests before starting development.
It ensures all parties agree on the requirements upfront. This approach clarifies expectations and defines what "done" means for features.
================================================================================
Q.) What is the importance of the Given-When-Then structure in BDD?
Ans.
     The Given-When-Then structure is a core concept of BDD that helps define clear scenarios.
     It improves readability, maintainability, and communication between team members.
     It helps break down complex features into manageable and understandable steps.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you handle data-driven testing in Cucumber?
Ans.
     Cucumber uses Scenario Outline and Examples tables to perform data-driven testing
================================================================================
Q.) What are some advantages of using BDD for test automation in Robot Framework?
Ans.
     Improved Collaboration using natural language test cases
     Living documentation that automatically gets updated as the code evolves
     Ensures that all critical user scenarios are covered in the test cases
     Natural language structure makes tests more readable and maintainable
================================================================================
Q.) How do you organize BDD scenarios and tests in Robot Framework to make them modular and maintainable?
Ans.    
     Tags: Use tags like @smoke, @regression, @login, etc., to categorize tests for easy filtering and execution.
     Keywords: Break down your tests into reusable keywords for each Given-When-Then step.
     Variables: Use variables to make your tests more flexible and reusable across different test cases.
================================================================================
Q.) What is a hook in BDD and how is it used in Robot Framework?
Ans.
     Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
         Special block of code or methods that are automatically executed at specific points during execution.
         Executed typically before or after a test scenario, allowing performing setup, cleanup, and reporting tasks.
         Can be run across multiple test cases, without repeating the code in each scenario itself.
         Defined as methods annotated with keywords like "@Before" and "@After" to specify when they should run.
     Robot Framework:
        Test Setup and Test Teardown can be considered as a form of hook in Robot Framework.
        These can be defined globally in the Settings section to apply them to all test cases or individually to specific test cases.
        Declared as keywords like “Test Setup” and "Test Teardown" to specify when they should run.
================================================================================ 

--- TestNG ---

================================================================================
Q.) How do you group test methods in TestNG?
Ans.
     In TestNG, you can group test methods using the groups attribute in the @Test annotation. This helps you organize tests into categories, like smoke or regression, and you can execute specific groups using the XML configuration.
================================================================================
Q.) How does TestNG integrate with Maven for test execution?
Ans.
     TestNG integrates with Maven using the maven-surefire-plugin to execute tests as part of the Maven build process. You configure this in the pom.xml file.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you specify the thread count for parallel execution in Maven?
Ans.
     In Maven, thread count for parallel execution can be specified in the testng.xml file or the maven-surefire-plugin.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you include or exclude specific tests in TestNG?
Ans.
     In TestNG, tests can be included or excluded using the groups attribute in the @Test annotation or in the testng.xml file.
================================================================================
Q.) What is the difference between @BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, and @BeforeMethod in TestNG?
Ans.
     These annotations are used to define setup methods that run at different levels of the test execution process.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you handle dependencies between test methods in TestNG?
Ans.
     In TestNG, dependencies between test methods are specified using dependsOnMethods or dependsOnGroups in the @Test annotation.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you integrate Selenium with TestNG?
Ans.
     You can integrate Selenium with TestNG by annotating test methods with @Test, and organizing tests with TestNG’s XML configuration file.
================================================================================
Q.) What are TestNG Listeners, and how do you implement them?
Ans.
     TestNG listeners allow you to listen to test execution events. You can implement ITestListener or ISuiteListener interfaces to track test execution progress or handle reporting.
================================================================================     
Q.) How do you integrate Cucumber with TestNG and POM?
Ans.
     Cucumber is integrated with TestNG by using the @CucumberOptions annotation in a TestNG runner class.
================================================================================
Q.) How do you handle different environments (e.g., dev, prod) in Cucumber with TestNG and POM?
Ans.
     Different environments can be handled using configuration files (e.g., .properties, .yml) and environment-specific profiles.
================================================================================ 

--- Cucumber ---

================================================================================ 
Q.) What is Cucumber, and how is it used in automation testing?
Ans.
     Cucumber is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework that allows writing tests in plain English using Gherkin syntax. It helps teams collaborate by writing tests that non-technical stakeholders can understand. It maps Gherkin steps to automation code for execution.
================================================================================ 
Q.) What is Gherkin syntax in Cucumber?
Ans.
     Gherkin is a simple, structured language used to write Cucumber tests. It follows the Given-When-Then format to describe app behavior. Example:
     Given the user is on the login page
     When the user enters valid credentials
     Then the user should be redirected to the homepage
================================================================================ 
Q.) How do you write scenarios in Cucumber?
Ans.
     Scenarios are written in a feature file using Gherkin syntax. A feature describes a part of the application, and each scenario defines a test case. Example:
     Given the user is on the registration page
     When the user enters valid details
     Then the user should be registered
================================================================================ 
Q.) How does Cucumber map Gherkin steps to Java code?
Ans.
     Cucumber maps Gherkin steps to Java methods using step definitions. Each Gherkin step is linked to a method in the Java code. Example:
     @Given("^the user is on the login page$")
     public void userIsOnLoginPage() {
       // Code to open the login page
     }
================================================================================ 
Q.) How do you run Cucumber tests with Maven?
Ans.
     You can run Cucumber tests using the Cucumber Maven Plugin. Configure it in the pom.xml to execute tests as part of the Maven build process. Example:
     <plugins>
       <plugin>
         <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
         <artifactId>cucumber-maven-plugin</artifactId>
         <version>YOUR_CUCUMBER_VERSION</version>
       </plugin>
     </plugins>
================================================================================ 
Q.) How do you perform data-driven testing in Cucumber?
Ans.
     Data-driven testing is done using Scenario Outline with an Examples table. This allows running the same scenario with different inputs. Example:
     Scenario Outline: User login with different credentials
       Given the user is on the login page
       When the user enters "<username>" and "<password>"
       Then the user should be logged in
     
     Examples:
       | username | password |
       | user1    | pass123  |
       | user2    | pass456  |
================================================================================ 
Q.) What is the purpose of the @Before and @After hooks in Cucumber?
Ans.
     @Before runs setup tasks before each scenario, like initializing the WebDriver.
     @After runs cleanup tasks after each scenario, like closing the browser. Example:
     @Before
     public void setup() { /* Setup code */ }
     
     @After
     public void teardown() { /* Cleanup code */ }
================================================================================ 
Q.) How do you implement Cucumber step definitions in Java?
Ans.
     In Java, step definitions are written using annotations like @Given, @When, and @Then. These methods contain the code for the corresponding steps in the Gherkin scenario. Example:
     @Given("the user is on the login page")
     public void userIsOnLoginPage() { /* Code to open login page */ }
     
     @When("the user enters valid credentials")
     public void userEntersValidCredentials() { /* Code to enter credentials */ }
     
     @Then("the user should be redirected to the homepage")
     public void userIsRedirectedToHomepage() { /* Code to verify redirection */ }
================================================================================ 
Q.) How do you organize step definitions in a large Cucumber project?
Ans.
     In large projects, organize step definitions by feature (e.g., LoginSteps.java, SearchSteps.java). Keep reusable code in utility classes to maintain clarity.
================================================================================ 
Q.) How do you use tags in Cucumber?
Ans.
     Tags categorize and filter scenarios. You can run tests with specific tags using the @CucumberOptions configuration. Example:
     @smoke
     Scenario: Valid login
       Given the user is on the login page
       When the user enters valid credentials
       Then the user should be redirected
================================================================================ 
Q.) How do you integrate Cucumber with TestNG?
Ans.
     Cucumber integrates with TestNG using the @CucumberOptions annotation to configure the test runner and manage execution, reporting, and parallel execution. Example:
     @CucumberOptions(
       features = "src/test/resources/features",
       glue = "com.stepdefinitions",
       plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-report"}
     )
     @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
     public class TestNGCucumberRunner {}
================================================================================ 
Q.) What is the role of the @Given, @When, and @Then annotations in Cucumber?
Ans.
     These annotations link the steps in Gherkin to Java methods. @Given sets up the initial context, @When describes the action, and @Then defines the expected outcome.

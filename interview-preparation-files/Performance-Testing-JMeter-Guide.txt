================================================================================
Q) What is Performance Testing?
Ans) Performance Testing is a type of non-functional testing used to determine the speed, responsiveness, scalability, and stability of a software application under a specific workload.
It helps identify performance bottlenecks before the system goes live.
======================================================================
Q) What are the types of Performance Testing?
Ans) Common types include:
1. Load Testing – Tests system under expected user load.
2. Stress Testing – Tests beyond maximum capacity.
3. Spike Testing – Tests sudden spikes in traffic.
4. Endurance (Soak) Testing – Tests system over extended time.
5. Scalability Testing – Tests system’s ability to scale with load.
================================================================================
Q) What is Apache JMeter?
Ans) Apache JMeter is an open-source tool used for performance and load testing of web applications, APIs, and other services.
	- Written in Java
	- Simulates multiple users by sending requests to the target server
	- Supports protocols like HTTP, FTP, JDBC, SOAP, REST, etc.
================================================================================
Q) What are the core elements of a JMeter Test Plan?
Ans) A JMeter Test Plan may include:
    1. Thread Group – Defines users, ramp-up, and loops
    2. Samplers – Define the requests (e.g., HTTP, JDBC)
    3. Listeners – Display results (Summary, Graphs, Tree)
    4. Assertions – Validate server responses
    5. Timers – Add think time or delays
    6. Config Elements – Set default values (e.g., base URL)
    7. Pre/Post Processors – Modify requests or extract data
================================================================================
Q) What is a Thread Group in JMeter?
Ans) A Thread Group simulates a group of virtual users performing a set of actions.
   It includes:
       Number of Threads (Users)
       Ramp-Up Period (in seconds)
       Loop Count (how many times users repeat the test)
Example: 10 users, 10-second ramp-up, loop count = 2 → 10 users start over 10 seconds and repeat test twice.
================================================================================
Q) What is an HTTP Request Sampler in JMeter?
Ans) This is used to send HTTP/HTTPS requests to a web server.You can configure - Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), Path/URL, Headers, Parameters, and Body data
================================================================================
Q) What are Listeners in JMeter?
Ans) Listeners collect and visualize performance test results.
  Common Listeners:
 View Results Tree – Shows request/response details
 Summary Report – Provides metrics like Avg, Min, Max, Throughput
 Aggregate Report – Consolidated performance stats
 Graph Results – Visual charts of response time/load
  Note: Avoid using too many listeners in large tests.
================================================================================
Q) What key metrics are analyzed in performance tests?
Ans)
 Response Time – Time to receive full response
 Latency – Time until first byte is received
 Throughput – Requests processed per second/minute
 Error % – Failed requests percentage
 Standard Deviation – Variation in response times
================================================================================
Q) What is an Assertion in JMeter?
Ans) Assertions are used to validate that the response from the server is correct.
  Types of Assertions:
1. Response Code Assertion – Check HTTP status code
2. Response Text Assertion – Check if response contains expected text
3. JSON/XML Assertion – Validate structured data
4. Size/Duration Assertion – Check length or response time
================================================================================
Q) What is Ramp-Up Period in JMeter?
Ans) Ramp-Up Period is the time JMeter will take to start all user threads.
   Example: If 10 users and a 10-second ramp-up are set, then 1 user starts per second.
   This avoids all users hitting the server at once.
================================================================================
Q) What is Think Time in performance testing?
Ans) Think Time is the delay between user actions.
   It mimics real user behavior (e.g., time spent reading a page).
   In JMeter, it’s implemented using:
    Constant Timer
    Gaussian Random Timer
    Uniform Random Timer
================================================================================
Q) Can JMeter be used for API Testing?
Ans) Yes, JMeter supports API testing by simulating HTTP/HTTPS requests and validating responses.It can add headers, send JSON/XML payload, handle dynamic data using variables or CSV files, and Validate with Assertions
================================================================================
Q) What is the difference between Response Time and Latency?
Ans)
    Response Time – Total time taken to receive the complete response
    Latency – Time until the first byte is received
    Latency is a part of total response time.
================================================================================
Q) How to run JMeter in Non-GUI mode?
Ans) Use this command:
    jmeter -n -t testplan.jmx -l results.jtl -e -o /report-folder  
 -n → Non-GUI mode
 -t → Path to test plan
 -l → Log file to store results
 -e -o → Generate HTML dashboard
================================================================================
Q) What is CSV Data Set Config in JMeter?
Ans) It allows data-driven testing using a CSV file.
Steps:
1. Add CSV Data Set Config to your Test Plan
2. Set file path, variable names, delimiter
3. Use variables like ${username} in your samplers
================================================================================
Q) What is Distributed Testing in JMeter?
Ans) Distributed Testing allows running a test from multiple machines to simulate higher load.
 Components:
   Master – Controls test
   Slaves – Execute test plan
 Command:
    jmeter -n -t testplan.jmx -R slave1IP,slave2IP  
================================================================================
Q) How can you integrate JMeter into CI/CD?
Ans)
1. Use Non-GUI command-line execution
2. Integrate into Jenkins/GitLab/GitHub Actions pipelines
3. Use Newman, Allure, or HTML reports for visibility
4. Export results as .jtl or HTML
   Example (in Jenkins):
        jmeter -n -t testplan.jmx -l result.jtl -e -o output-folder  
================================================================================
Q) What are some alternatives to JMeter?
Ans)
 Gatling – Scala-based, developer-friendly
 k6 – JavaScript-based, CLI-first, good for CI
 Locust – Python-based, scriptable
 BlazeMeter – Cloud-based platform compatible with JMeter
 LoadRunner – Enterprise-level tool
================================================================================
Q) What is the use of jmeter.properties file?
Ans) This file contains global settings for JMeter, such as: Timeout settings, Logging options, Thread limits. You can modify this to customize JMeter behavior for specific environments.
================================================================================
Q) What is Throughput in JMeter?
Ans) Throughput is the number of requests processed by the server per unit of time (typically seconds or minutes). Higher throughput = better performance under load.
================================================================================
Q) What are the limitations of JMeter?
Ans)
 - High memory usage in GUI mode
 - Not a real browser – cannot test JavaScript-heavy UIs
 - Limited support for modern web protocols (e.g., WebSockets, gRPC without plugins)
 - Requires scripting for complex scenarios
